<h1>Who We Are</h1>

<p>We are ChicagoRuby, a group of Ruby and Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.
  Our meetings are a place where we share our knowledge and excitement about
  the language and the framework. Our group holds multiple events each month
  in the Chicago area. Sign up at
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/">Meetup.com</a> to get the exact
  date, time, and location for each meeting.</p>

<h1>Annual Conferences</h1>

<p>In addition to our monthly events, ChicagoRuby produces multiple annual
  conferences. WindyCityRails, Chicago’s Ruby on Rails conference, started in
  2008 to fill what had been a void of Ruby conferences in the midwest.
  In 2015, ChicagoRuby produced the inaugural WindyCityThings, a conference
  focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). We’re also currently in the
  planning stages for RubyCaribe, a Ruby conference with deep-dive lab
  session in Barbados.</p>

<h1>Our History</h1>

<p>ChicagoRuby has its roots in two Ruby user groups that merged in July 2009:
  Chirb and ChicagoRuby. Today, ChicagoRuby has grown to nearly 4,000 members
  and has held hundreds of free meetups throughout the Chicagoland area.</p>
