# ChicagoRuby Code of Conduct

## Summary

ChicagoRuby is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including
talks, workshops, the vendor hall, parties, Twitter and other online media.

## What Defines Harassment?

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. Any event participant who engages in harassing behavior may be
asked to leave the event.

## If You Need Help

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizer team immediately.
Members of the organizer team are introduced at the start of each event.

The organizer team will be happy to help participants contact venue security
or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and are
committed to your safety and security.
