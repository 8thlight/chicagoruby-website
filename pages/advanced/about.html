  <h1>Annual Conferences</h1>

  <p>In addition to our monthly events, ChicagoRuby produces multiple annual
    conferences. <a href="https://windycityrails.com">WindyCityRails</a>,
    Chicago’s Ruby on Rails conference, started in 2008 to fill what had been a
    void of Ruby conferences in the midwest. In 2015, ChicagoRuby produced the
    inaugural <a href="https://windycitythings.com">WindyCityThings</a>, a
    conference focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). We’re also currently in
    the planning stages for <a href="http://rubycaribe.com">RubyCaribe</a>, a
    Ruby conference with deep-dive lab session in Barbados.</p>

<section class="section-about-history">
