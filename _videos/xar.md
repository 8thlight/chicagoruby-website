Docker’s lightweight virtualization may supplant our hypervisor-backed VMs at some point in the future, and change the way that tomorrow's Ruby applications are architected, packaged and deployed. Using Docker, your Ruby applications will sit atop an excellent platform for packing, shipping and running low-overhead, isolated execution environments. You will get a brief intro to the Docker ecosystem, get to know the tools and processes needed to create containerized Ruby applications, and learn best practices for interacting with the Docker API from Ruby.
