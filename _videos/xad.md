Front end JavaScript is a swampland of buzzwords, leaky abstractions, and complicated toolchains. Fortunately, there are some simple techniques developers can use to avoid the quagmire and build dynamic, modern user interfaces that solve human problems. In this video, the presenter will show a technique for embedding JavaScript components inside of otherwise server rendered pages to create islands of interactivity. This can be done with an existing build system, adding nothing but 20KB of gzipped JavaScript and a dash of common sense.
