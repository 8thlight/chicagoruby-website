This presentation is about the challenges of building large Ruby web applications and how to maintain or rescue existing ones. The presenter will use examples adapted from real production applications that he worked on during 10 years of working with Ruby. The presentation will cover technical limitations of the language, how to use a modular dependency structure, and how to enforce strict rules in complex domains.
