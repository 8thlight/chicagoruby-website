Relational databases and NoSQL document stores are generally considered to be at opposing extremes. Schemas and SQL are perceived to be at the core of the problem with relational databases. Akiban Server is an open source database that brings document stores and relational databases together. Developers get powerful document access and schema evolution capabilities alongside surprisingly powerful SQL. The presenter, Ori Herrnstadt, will cover the architecture and operational ideas that underlie the Akiban Server. A demo of a Sinatra web application developed against the Akiban Server will be shown. Integration with the SEQUEL database toolkit for Ruby will also be demonstrated showing how the document access in the Akiban Server provides leads to a happy/powerful developer experience. The presenter invites you to download Akiban Server Early Developer Release prior to the meetup.
