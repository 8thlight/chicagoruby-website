teaser: Many web developers came to Ruby through Rails. Ever since Rails came out, the watch has been on for the "Rails of X". Meteor (http://meteor.com/) may be the Rails of JavaScript, and it's not unreasonable to expect some ideas coming full circle back to Ruby on Rails in the future.

[Slides on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/pkaushik/meteor-2013) _Video Note: We experienced a glitch during the first fifteen minutes, and some of the video was lost. We apologize for the problem. Most of the video remains intact._ Many web developers came to Ruby through Rails. Ever since Rails came out, the watch has been on for the "Rails of X". [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) may be the Rails of JavaScript, and it's not unreasonable to expect some ideas coming full circle back to Ruby on Rails in the future. Meteor is the first open-source full stack platform for developing and deploying end-to-end JavaScript applications. With observable server side models, live DOM updates, hot code pushes, latency compensation and smart synchronization baked in, it's a leap forward in making real time collaborative web applications. We will take a quick look at Meteor - where it came from, what it is capable of today, and where it seems to be headed. We'll also have a brief code walk-through and demonstration of a project implemented in Backbone and Meteor.
