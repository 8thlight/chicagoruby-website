teaser: Understand the pros and cons of metaprogramming
speaker: James Courtois and Hugo Corbucci
speaker_bio: "**James Courtois** is an Application Developer for ThoughtWorks, a recent graduate of the University of Chicago where he studied pure mathematics, and a relative newcomer to the world of Ruby. As a software developer, he's driven by a passion for functional programming, esoterica, and magnums of champagne. **Hugo Corbucci** is a lead consultant at ThoughtWorks, board member of Agile Alliance Brazil and hopeful rock climber. He has dwelt into the Java world for about six or seven years until four years ago he accepted the reality that he would hardly get Smalltalk back to life and moved to its less good implementation: Ruby."

Given a bizarre set of evolving project requirements, we will explore a variety of techniques in metaprogramming to get work done. In doing so, we just might encounter some merits and many problems associated with writing code that changes code. Topics to be covered include monkeypatching, dynamic method generation, redefining method missing, string interpolation, and a few more complicated examples.
