teaser: Web development pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but of character.
speaker: Abraham Sangha
speaker_bio: Abraham Sangha is a web developer via Dev Bootcamp Chicago. He has spent
  the last six months diving into service-oriented architecture and RESTful APIs with
  technologies such as Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and Solr. He is a former civil engineer
  and minister who wishes he could freestyle rap well. He studied virtue in graduate
  school but lays expert claim to none of them, and his first program was a choose-your-own-adventure
  game written during algebra class on a TI-82 graphing calculator.

As a new Ruby developer, Abraham expected to be challenged intellectually as he dove into algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented design, but he was disturbed to realize that coding, especially in an Agile workflow, actually challenged him personally. Web development pushes us to our limits, not only of cognition, but of character. Character has been discussed by moral philosophers such as Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas using the framework of the cardinal virtues: courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. We will consider how these virtues apply to our experiences as developers, and how we can grow not only as coders, but as human beings.
