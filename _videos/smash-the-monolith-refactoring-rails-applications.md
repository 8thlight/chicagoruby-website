Much of the promise of Rails as a web framework is convention over configuration, the luxury of focusing on business logic over architecture. But successful applications can rapidly grow to unmanageable sizes and become difficult to maintain or extend. There are alternatives to being held hostage by large-scale, single-application architectures. In this talk we will explore refactoring using object-oriented design principles and learn how applying these techniques can save us from our monolithic code bases.
