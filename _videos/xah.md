The talk will explore the recent trend toward rich, thick-client applications talking directly to cloud data stores and cloud-based services for protected workloads & service orchestration. The "serverless" approach enables organizations to focus on code instead of infrastructure by taking advantage of managed cloud services. To be clear, this concept doesn't entirely do away with servers, but places the responsibility for managing, securing, and patching them onto the service provider. This discussion will explore the current ecosystem of products and services available for taking advantage of the "serverless" architecture as well as some strategies for use in your own implementation.
