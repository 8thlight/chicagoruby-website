Helpers in Rails have always been second-class citizens. They have been abused in most Rails projects, burgeoning into unmaintainable chunks of code. This talk will explore how View models and Presenters can serve as a cleaner and much more elegant alternative to the use of conventional Rails helpers. It will also attempt to present situations where the two can be leveraged in a Rails project.
