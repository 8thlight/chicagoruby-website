Functional programming is more popular than ever. Languages like Clojure, Haskell, Scala, and F# are popping up everywhere. Even Apple’s new Swift language has a functional flavor to it. The popularity of SICP study groups seems to be at an all time high. What’s a poor Ruby programmer to do? If you’re using JRuby, you might be able to integrate with Clojure or Scala, but what about the rest of us? This is where the RubyLisp project comes in. It’s an open source implementation of a large chunk of the Scheme language, written in pure Ruby and easily integratable into a plain ol’ Ruby app or a RubyMotion app. This talk will introduce RubyLisp, both the language itself as well as how to integrate it into a Ruby app.
