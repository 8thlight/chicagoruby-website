Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Wozniak. These are all people who’ve never been in our kitchens. We’ve never had even a passing head nod with whilst coming out of the bathroom. What size shoes do they wear? What’s their favorite color? Do they know all the lyrics to Katy Perry’s Roar? We don’t know. But perhaps by taking a look at our collective past, we can find these answers, and maybe learn a little bit about our future. Or at the very least we’ll get to see pictures of really big computers from the olden days!
