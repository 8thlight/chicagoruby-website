Why does cryptography actually work? Cryptography is based on number theory.
This presentation will touch on things like: what Number Theory is, why primes
are important, why factoring is hard, how this allows us to build cryptosystems
(e.g. RSA), and maybe some unsolved problems (there are many!) in Number Theory.
