Stories answer questions in a wonderful, sometimes roundabout way that permits the inclusion of contextual details left out of straightforward answers. And they are much more fun to listen to. In this Q&A session, Alistair Cockburn solicits questions from the audience and answers them by telling stories from the hundreds of projects and companies he has seen. Watch to see what stories were told.
